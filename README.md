# isomod-GUI
A simple GUI that simplifies the use of isomod. (Intended for PaRappa the Rapper 2 Modding)

# Installing and using
You can build from source or you can use a pre-built executable file.

## From source
To build isomod-gui, you need the following dependencies on your system: **Qt5** (or newer), **CMake 3.5** (or newer), and a C++ compiler. At the root of the directory, you will need to run these commands:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install (not necessary but can be used if wanted)

Output will be in the root directory in a folder called "out". (isomod-gui/out)

## Pre-built
If there are any executables pre-built and available, you can find them on the [Releases](https://github.com/CryptoCANINE/isomod-gui/releases) page. This can be ran on OS X, but it must be built from source on a Macintosh.

# What is isomod?
isomod is an application that allows the injection of files into ISO images (ISO9660) without re-building the image (kind of like in UltraISO). This tool makes modding PaRappa the Rapper 2 easier and more efficiently done.

# To-do
~~- Polish the GUI~~
- Make things work and look better overall
- Remove Sweets, and add more Noodles
